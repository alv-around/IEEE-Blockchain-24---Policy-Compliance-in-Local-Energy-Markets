\subsection{Climate Change in CS World}
Climate change is targeted from computer science two-fold \cite{cs_cc}: by mitigating the direct negative impact of computers on the environment through reduction of energy consumption and associated socio-economic costs and by enhancing existing processes to improve their efficiency. As this paper focuses on the latter, we wont discuss the mitigation of its negative impact further. 

In mitigation and adaptation strategies for existing systems, Machine Learning (ML) \cite{MachineLearning} and Artificial Intelligence (AI) \cite{AI_CC} could be utilised, such as enhancing energy systems, optimizing transportation or aiding urban planning. However, their net impact on carbon emissions remains ambiguous due to the increased demand for hardware and energy \cite{AI_CC_2}.
