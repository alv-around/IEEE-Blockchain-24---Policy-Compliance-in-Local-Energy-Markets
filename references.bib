abstract = {Basic concepts and terminology for trustworthy software systems are discussed. Our discussion of definitions for terms in the domain of trustworthy software systems is based on former achievements in dependable, trustworthy and survivable systems. We base our discussion on the established literature and on approved standards. These concepts are discussed in the context of our graduate school TrustSoft on trustworthy software systems. In TrustSoft, we consider trustworthiness of software systems as determined by correctness, safety, quality of service (performance, reliability, availability), security, and privacy. Particular means to achieve trustworthiness of component-based software systems - as investigated in TrustSoft - are formal verification, quality prediction and certification; complemented by fault diagnosis and fault tolerance for increased robustness.},
